Stupid and simple Sinatra-based Tesla Model S status page.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/psy-q/smodel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/psy-q/smodel)

Note that I have absolutely no clue about Sinatra, so this
application is surely crap in the eyes of anyone with more
than two hours Sinatra experience.

I just use it so I can see my Model S current status without
using any of Tesla's proprietary applications.


## Future plans

Feel free to help with the development of this thing! I will
try to add some test coverage in the future so that becomes
easier.

Some ideas:

* Allow actually updating some of the car's settings (maximum
charge percentage, etc.)

* More prettiful pages.
